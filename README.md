# StoreManagementAPI
A simple Java application, with Maven and Spring Boot, that exposes an API for managing a catalog of products, in a secure way.
This was designed as a minimum viable product that would have the following features:
- Add a product
- Update the price and name of a product
- Find a product
- List all products

From an implementation point of view, the following were set:
- Basic security
- Basic authentication
- Role based endpoint access
- Error handling
- Error and warning logging
- Unit testing with coverage close to 100%
- Demonstrate the use of Java 17+ features like sealed classes and pattern matching for switch 

For sure, some areas will need further development, if going past the MVP phase, for example: using a database for persistence, do a proper user management without hardcoding etc.

## Building And Running

In an IDE, after project import, you can just run
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Alternatively, you can run
```bash
mvn clean install package
java -jar .\target\StoreManagementAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
## Authentication
```bash
Role: User
Username: user
Password: userPass

Role: Admin
Username: admin
Password: adminPass
```

## Data model
